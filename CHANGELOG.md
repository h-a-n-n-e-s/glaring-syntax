* Every feature added
* Every bug fixed

## 0.2.0 - Second Release
* normal text color changed to off-white
* variables color changed to white
* patched some confusion from language-latex package about using math mode '$...$' in normal text.
The '$' is not always recognized as the end of math mode, which changes large portions of the text
to 'string' instead of 'normal text'.
* patched usage of '[a:b]' usage in gnuplot scripts
